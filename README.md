# Practice_on_kaggle_dataset
This is my personal work on some kaggle datasets to practice ML and Dl techniques.

1. Email Spam classification: The dataset is a csv file containing related information of 5172 randomly picked email files and their respective labels for spam or not-spam classification ( 1 for spam, 0 for not spam). I have implemented Naive bayes classifier, logistic regression, SVM ( for differennt weight and kernels) and a Linear NN also a NN with non linear activation functions using pytorch.
